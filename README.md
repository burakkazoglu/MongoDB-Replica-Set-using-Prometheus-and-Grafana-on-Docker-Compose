# Docker Compose Running MongoDB Replica Set

## Components
* `MongoDB:` is a NoSQL document-based database.
* `Prometheus:` open-source monitoring and alarming tool used to collect metrics from various systems.
* `Grafana:` multi-platform open-source analytics and interactive visualization tool. It provides charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources.
* `MongoDB Exporter:` will be used to convert MongoDB parameters into a format understandable by Prometheus.

## What is it?
This `docker-compose` setup starts a local mongo replica set with 3 instances running on: 
- mongodb1:27018
- mongodb2:27019
- mongodb3:27020

## Are there any prerequisites? 
* Docker
* Docker Compose
* The following in your `/etc/hosts` file:
```
127.0.0.1       mongodb1
127.0.0.1       mongodb2
127.0.0.1       mongodb3
```

## How do I run the Replica Set?
Simples:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

## How do I access the Mongo Shells for each Instance?
```
docker exec -it mongo1 sh -c "mongo --port 30001"
docker exec -it mongo2 sh -c "mongo --port 30002"
docker exec -it mongo3 sh -c "mongo --port 30003"
```

## Robo 3T
I used Robo 3T to test it locally and used the following config for the connection:

## Connecting with URI
```
mongodb://mongodb1:27018,mongodb2:27019,mongodb3:27020/?replicaSet=replicaname
```
